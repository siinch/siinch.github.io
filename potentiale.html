            <h2>ABOUT POTENTIALE</h2>
            <p>
                Potentiale is a classic platformer filled with atmosphere
                and motivational quotes, to help guide the player through their
                journey. It was made with the Unity game engine.
                <br><br>
                Potentiale started as a school project, to see if a
                game could be designed to give people a more positive
                outlook on life. It was made in 2015 and is the first
                game I ever finished and released.
                <br><br>
                The experiments showed that Potentiale did not have any
                significant effect on the positivity of the testers.
                However, it has managed to remind me of my passion for
                game development many times.
